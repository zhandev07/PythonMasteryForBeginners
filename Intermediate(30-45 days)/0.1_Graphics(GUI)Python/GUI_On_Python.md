Introduction to Tkinter
Tkinter is a Python library used to create simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It comes pre-installed with Python, so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.

Before we go into each element, let's break down some fundamental concepts to help you understand how Tkinter works.

Basic Components of a Tkinter Application
Widgets: Widgets are the elements of your GUI, like buttons, labels, text boxes, etc.
Mainloop: Tkinter runs an event loop where it waits for user interaction (like clicking a button) and responds accordingly.
Geometry Management: Tkinter controls how widgets are placed inside windows using layout managers.
