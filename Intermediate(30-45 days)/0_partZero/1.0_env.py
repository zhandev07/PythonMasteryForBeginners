# Install Python-dotenv: First, install the python-dotenv package, which helps you read environment variables from a .env file:

# pip install python-dotenv

# Create a .env File: In the same folder as your Python script, create a new file called .env. Inside it, you can store your API keys and other sensitive information like this:


# API_KEY=your_api_key_here
