# Imagine you live in an apartment building:
# The building (package) contains several rooms (modules).
# Bedroom (bedroom.py)
# Kitchen (kitchen.py)
# Living Room (living_room.py)

# You might call your apartment package my_home.

# Create a folder. Inside that folder, put your related modules.
# Inside the folder, add a file named __init__.py. This file can be empty, but it tells Python that this folder is a package.
# Hereâ€™s an example structure:


# my_home/             # This is the package
    # __init__.py      # Indicates this folder is a package
    # bedroom.py       # Contains bedroom-related functions
    # kitchen.py       # Contains kitchen-related functions
    # living_room.py   # Contains living room-r
